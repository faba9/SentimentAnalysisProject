# Sentiment Analysis Project

I have created this page to implement Neural Network technology to conduct sentiment analysis of Amazon products to help anyone wants general information about phones on Amazon by giving this information such as the percentage of positive, negative, and natural reviews.




## How It Works?

Reviews Analysis tools attempt to extract the data , tags, sentiment, and more from a valid phone name


In this web page We have used the neural network algorithm to analyze the sentiment of the reviews.



## Tools Used:
LSTM neural network



Social Sentiment Analysis: assigns sentiment ratings of "positive", "negative" and "neutral"



Get reviews : scrapes the amazon website for all the phone products and returns them as data
